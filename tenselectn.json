Some parts were a breeze, others, not so much. But hey, it's standing, it looks decent, and I didn't lose any fingers in the process. Win-win, right?

Having made up my mind to learn programming in particular, I decided to focus on Python and started the '100 Days of Code' course on Udemy. The drawback? With my family and a full-time job to balance, I could only dedicate 20 to 30 minutes a day to my online coursework. Day 1 and Day 2 took me about three weeks to complete, which is a monument to my perseverance in the face of difficulty. The reality check arrived quickly, as doubters questioned if it was possible to succeed in programming in such a short amount of time. However, I'm looking for inspiration from you all. Are there other people who, like me, are juggling a lot of duties while yet daring to hope for a career in coding? My ambition is to use my newly acquired talents to earn a part-time income in the future as I persevere through the 100 Days of Code. Though the journey may take longer than the customary 100 days, every line of code represents an achievement. Talk about your experiences and insights, and together, let's build a community that encourages dreamers like us. I am delighted to share my motivation and progress as a programmer ",

This was the toughest endurance test in my life. What a feeling afterwards! Next up, Ironman 70.3? A bit of the background, I can play 10+ sports but never considered running to be one of them. Last year in March, I ran my first mini marathon of 7.5KM in Hatirjheel. I instantly got hooked and then pushed all my friends and families to participate in one of these running events. But why? I got to track and test my endurance level I got inspired to take my health seriously I loved the participants who are always super supportive. One of the best communities for sure It helped me get my stamina back My endurance in other sports and even in usual desk job got a lot better The medals are super amazing. I have finally started collecting medals When you run with your friends and family, it‚Äôs a great mini adventure for all I got to have some ambitious health related targets Well there‚Äôs a few more which probably won‚Äôt be relatable for many. So, I‚Äôll skip those. Those who are still reading, I genuinely invite you to participate in one of the mini marathons first & you can test it yourself if it‚Äôs a thing for you as well.",

Later, I grew a SaaS to $3,000 MRR, but I started to see my journey as a failure after 4 years of grind. I got depressed in 2021 and quit entrepreneurship. I worked for Tai Lopez as a product manager to overcome my depression. It worked because I finally had a sense of purpose. When I got fired in November 2021, it didn‚Äôt matter. I had a dream. I discovered my role models on Twitter: Pieter Levels, Danny Postma, and other cool kids working solo on their projects from anywhere in the world, making much more money than needed to live comfortably. I wanted freedom. I was living in Bali, $20,000 in the bank, no audience, and bad coding skills.",

Starting with a passion for culinary arts and a vision for a unique food experience, I navigated through the complexities of the industry. The initial phase involved extensive market research to understand consumer preferences and identify gaps in the market. With a solid business plan in place, I tackled the logistical hurdles of sourcing quality ingredients, establishing relationships with suppliers, and setting up a kitchen space. Building an online presence through social media and a user-friendly website played a pivotal role in reaching a wider audience. As the business gained momentum, customer feedback became a valuable tool for refining the menu and enhancing the overall dining experience. Collaborations with local events and food festivals helped to expand the brand's visibility. Despite facing unforeseen challenges, the first year marked significant milestones and growth, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, resilience, and a genuine passion for the culinary craft in the demanding and rewarding world of food entrepreneurship.",
