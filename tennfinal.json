Later, I grew a SaaS to $3,000 MRR, but I started to see my journey as a failure after 4 years of grind. I got depressed in 2021 and quit entrepreneurship. I worked for Tai Lopez as a product manager to overcome my depression. It worked because I finally had a sense of purpose. When I got fired in November 2021, it didn’t matter. I had a dream. I discovered my role models on Twitter: Pieter Levels, Danny Postma, and other cool kids working solo on their projects from anywhere in the world, making much more money than needed to live comfortably. I wanted freedom. I was living in Bali, $20,000 in the bank, no audience, and bad coding skills.",

With my family and a full-time job to balance, I could only dedicate 20 to 30 minutes a day to my online coursework. Day 1 and Day 2 took me about three weeks to complete, which is a monument to my perseverance in the face of difficulty. The reality check arrived quickly, as doubters questioned if it was possible to succeed in programming in such a short amount of time. However, I'm looking for inspiration from you all. Are there other people who, like me, are juggling a lot of duties while yet daring to hope for a career in coding? My ambition is to use my newly acquired talents to earn a part-time income in the future as I persevere through the 100 Days of Code. Though the journey may take longer than the customary 100 days, every line of code represents an achievement. Talk about your experiences and insights, and together, let's build a community that encourages dreamers like us. I am delighted to share my motivation and progress as a programmer ",

This endurance test was the toughest in my life, but the feeling afterward was incredible! Considering an Ironman 70.3 next. Background: Not a runner, but after a 7.5KM mini marathon last March, I got hooked. Tested endurance, prioritized health, joined a supportive community, improved stamina, and started collecting medals. Running with friends and family became a mini adventure. For those still reading, I invite you to try a mini marathon—test it yourself and see if it becomes your thing too!",

Starting with a classic pizza dough recipe, I kneaded the soft and elastic dough, allowing it to rise to perfection. The kitchen was soon filled with the irresistible aroma of tomato sauce simmering on the stove, enriched with herbs and spices for that authentic flavor. Assembling the pizza became a creative process, spreading the sauce over the dough and generously layering it with a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Toppings ranging from pepperoni to colorful bell peppers added a burst of flavors and textures. The oven transformed my culinary creation into a golden, bubbling masterpiece. The final result was a crisp, yet tender, crust supporting a medley of savory ingredients—a homemade pizza that not only satisfied my craving but also provided a sense of accomplishment and the joy of sharing a delicious meal with loved ones.",
