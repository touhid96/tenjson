Later, I grew a SaaS to $3,000 MRR, but I started to see my journey as a failure after 4 years of grind. I got depressed in 2021 and quit entrepreneurship. I worked for Tai Lopez as a product manager to overcome my depression. It worked because I finally had a sense of purpose. When I got fired in November 2021, it didn’t matter. I had a dream. I discovered my role models on Twitter: Pieter Levels, Danny Postma, and other cool kids working solo on their projects from anywhere in the world, making much more money than needed to live comfortably. I wanted freedom. I was living in Bali, $20,000 in the bank, no audience, and bad coding skills.",

Starting with a classic pizza dough recipe, I kneaded the soft and elastic dough, allowing it to rise to perfection. The kitchen was soon filled with the irresistible aroma of tomato sauce simmering on the stove, enriched with herbs and spices for that authentic flavor. Assembling the pizza became a creative process, spreading the sauce over the dough and generously layering it with a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Toppings ranging from pepperoni to colorful bell peppers added a burst of flavors and textures. The oven transformed my culinary creation into a golden, bubbling masterpiece. The final result was a crisp, yet tender, crust supporting a medley of savory ingredients—a homemade pizza that not only satisfied my craving but also provided a sense of accomplishment and the joy of sharing a delicious meal with loved ones.",

In this rapidly evolving landscape, my team and I undertake on a significant project—the development of a crop cultivation robot. This narrative unfolds through the robot's perspective, detailing its learning journey and challenges in mastering cultivation tasks. Starting with basic functions like seed planting and weed removal, the robot's journey involved refining and expanding its codebase to autonomously execute intricate cultivation actions. The result is a significant achievement in the realm of crop cultivation robotics.",
